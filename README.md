Community‑Driven Reward‑Token Hitchhiking App & Movement

🌍 Project Vision
HITCH is not just a ride-sharing application — it's a cultural shift that transforms everyday travel into a communal adventure. Users—Riders (Hitchers) and Pilots (Drivers)—share rides for short to medium distances (500 m–200 km) and earn reward tokens instead of cash. Tokens unlock real-world rewards from partner brands, fostering exploration, sustainability, and social connection.

We want HITCH to become an everyday habit, not just an app, by weaving gamified features, community storytelling, and social status into the fabric of urban mobility.
